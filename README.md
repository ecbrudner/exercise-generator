# exercise-generator

## Description

Who among us hasn’t dreaded their workout?
They say the hardest part is just getting yourself to the gym, but once you’ve made it, there are still so many decisions.
Don’t fall victim to decision paralysis. Use Gym Genius.

Gym Genius will generate exercises for you at the touch of a button. 
And it will provide all of the info you need for an effective workout!

In creating this app, we practiced using Node and Express to create a RESTful API, incorporating MySQL and Sequelize as our database, using Handlebars templates as views, creating several API routes, incorporating user authentication and utilizing Tailwind styling.

## Installation

In order to use the app, the user will need both Node.js, MySQL2, Sequelize. [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) are instructions for installing Node. [Here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) are instructions for installing MySQL2. [Here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) are instructions for installing Sequelize.

## Usage

When the user accesses Gym Genius, they will login, then click a "Let's Get Started" on the homepage to randomly generate an exercise. 
The page will display the name of the exercise, the body part used, equipment needed, instructions and a demonstration gif.
